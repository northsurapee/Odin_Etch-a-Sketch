About Event Object (e)
- 'e' is the event object, representing the event that occurred (in this case, a mousemove event).
- 'e.target' is the element that triggered the event, which is the sizeSlider in this case.
- 'e.target.value' is used to access the current value of the sizeSlider element, 
  and this value is then passed to the updateSizeValue function to update the size value.
